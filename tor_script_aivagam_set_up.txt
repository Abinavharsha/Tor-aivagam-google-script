Script Overview
This Python script automates the process of performing Google searches using the Tor network to maintain anonymity. It repeatedly sends search requests to Google with randomized user-agents, languages, and other headers to avoid detection or blocking. After each request, the script requests a new IP from the Tor network to further anonymize the traffic.

## Server Set up 
##### Requirements to run the Script
- Install Python 3 and pip
- Install python required modules - stem, requests
- Python3 environment
- Installation of tor
- Necessary permissions to run the script

##### Tor installation and configuration

` sudo apt install tor -y '

Configuartion steps are below:
1. Edit the Tor configuration file: ` sudo nano /etc/tor/torrc `
2. Uncomment (or add) the following lines to enable control port access:
```
ControlPort 9051
HashedControlPassword 16:HASHED_PASSWORD
```
3. To generate the HashedControlPassword for your script, run the following: ` tor --hash-password welcome12345 `
[Replace welcome12345 with the password you want to use in your script, or update the password in your script to match the one generated.]
4.Restart Tor to Apply the Changes ` sudo systemctl restart tor `

##### Script Execution steps
1. sudo systemctl restart tor , to start tor service
2. Cd to/the/script/directory , switch to the script dir
3. source /venv/bin/activate, enter the python environment
4. python3 tor_script_aivagam_log_source.py ,  to run the script
5. ctrl + c, to stop the process
6. deactivate, to exit the python environment


##### Script components
1. tor_aivagam_source.txt - contains the wordlists that are set to be searched
2. tor_script_log.txt - contains the summary of the script process
